PARTITION MANAGEMENT (LVM) 

 

1. df -h = shows you the already mounted drive 

2. lsblk =shows you all the volumes/block available on the sever 

3. fdisk =  To initialise the volume 

4. To add another drive (/dev/sdb) so as to start partitioning, firstly you if it is hypervisor-1, you dont need to turn off the server. But with hypervisor-2, you might need to turn off the sever, so as to to add the drive. > go to settings on your virtual box > storage> controller SATA> hard disk >create> then choose 

5. lsblk = Shows you the block/volume 

6. fdisk /dev/sdb = to initialize => you will see the following display 

 Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.23.2). 

 

Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them. 

Be careful before using the write command. 

 

Device does not contain a recognized partition table 

Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x48bdf5d2. 

7. n =  to create new partitionn 

8. p = primary partition 

9. 1 = partion number 1, the press enter 

10. +4G = means you want to partition the first drive to be 4G 

11. p = print partition table 

12. t = to give it an LVM id number 

13. type 8e and press enter  = that change the default ID no to LVM ID no 

14. To see if the partition ID is changed, you type P, then enter 

15. To write/save = Type “w” then enter. 

16. Repeat number 7-15 to create several partition 

NOW, we start the process of creating logical volume 

 

17. pvcreate = to create a physical volume=  pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdb3 (if dont do pvcreate, you wount be able to add them all as volume-group 

 You will see below prompt. 

  

Physical volume "/dev/sdb1" successfully created. 

  Physical volume "/dev/sdb2" successfully created. 

  Physical volume "/dev/sdb3" successfully created. 

 

Now we create a volume group 

18. vgcreate= to create volume group = for instance you want to create volume group of 5G and name the volume “artdata”, then type the following command.= vgcreate artdata /dev/sdb1 devsdb3  

You will see the followin message  

 Volume group "artdata" successfully created 

To check physical volume=pvs 

 

19. To check volume group= vgs 

 

Now we create a Logical volume  

 

20. lvcreate -L +3G -n lv_data artdata ( lvcreate (-L=argument to create LV) (+3G size you inted to give the logical volume) (-n= Name you intend to give the logical volume) (lv_data= Name of the logical volume) (artdata= The volume group which the logica volume will be created from) 

 

You will see the following message  

 Logical volume "lv_data" created. 

21. To check the logival volume = lvs 

 

Now for you to be able to use the logical volume created, you need to add a file system to it. 

 

22. To make it an xfs-file system, you type the following command= mkfs.xfs /dev/artdata/lv_data or mkfs -t xfs /dev/artdata/lv_data 

 

You will see the following display 

  isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=196608 blks 

         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1 

         =                       crc=1        finobt=0, sparse=0

         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
